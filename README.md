# Spatial Data Analysis of Public Bus Transportation

I am excited to share my latest project in the field of data analysis and geospatial insights. In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of public bus transportation data to gain valuable insights into the efficiency and performance of the bus network in a major metropolitan area.

**Project Highlights:**

🌐 **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** I started by importing and cleaning large datasets that included bus routes, stops, and GPS trajectory data. I handled missing values, sorted the data, and ensured its quality.

📊 **Data Visualization:** Utilizing Python libraries such as pandas, geopandas, and matplotlib, I created insightful visualizations to help understand the patterns in bus routes, stops, and trajectories.

🚍 **Spatial Outlier Detection:** I identified spatial outliers in the GPS trajectory data to pinpoint instances where buses deviated significantly from their expected routes. This information was crucial for improving service reliability.

📈 **Data Analysis:** I calculated key statistics such as the number of vehicles, average daily signals, and the distribution of records per bus. These statistics provided valuable insights into the performance of the bus network.

🗺️ **Geospatial Analysis:** Geospatial techniques allowed me to analyze the distance between bus stops, calculate bus speed, and identify areas with high and low acceleration.

🔍 **Challenges Overcome:** During the project, I encountered challenges in handling large datasets and ensuring data accuracy. I successfully addressed these issues to obtain meaningful results.

**Future Work:** This project is just the beginning. In the future, I plan to delve deeper into this dataset, exploring more advanced analytics, and developing predictive models to optimize public bus transportation.
